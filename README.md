Overview

This project features a Recipe blog system where users can write and submit blogs. By default, the submitted Recipe blogs are not visible on the website until they are reviewed and approved by an admin. This ensures that only appropriate content is published.

How It Works

User Submission: Users submit Recipe blogs through a user interface.

Flagging: The is_active flag for each new Recipe blog is automatically set to 0.

Admin Review: Admin users access the Django admin interface to review submitted blogs.

Approval: Admin users can approve blogs by setting the is_active flag to 1.

Visibility: Approved Recipe blogs become visible on the website.
